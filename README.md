Hello, fellow data enthusiasts! Welcome to my collection of data science projects. Here, you will find various projects that I have worked on.

I have used Python extensively for these projects, covering key aspects such as data cleaning, data preparation, and also data visualization.
I am continuously adding new projects to this collection, exploring different domains and problem statements. My goal is to leverage machine learning algorithms and techniques to solve real-world problems and make meaningful predictions
Feel free to explore the projects and provide your valuable feedback. I am open to any suggestions, comments, or collaborations. Let's dive into the exciting world of data science and machine learning together!
